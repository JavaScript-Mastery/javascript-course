// write code for differentiate to spread operator and rest operator

const spreadOperator = () => {
    return `The spread operator is used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into places where multiple elements can fit. It's mostly used in variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected.`
}

const restOperator = () => {
    return `The rest operator is used to merge multiple elements into an array. It's mostly used in function where there is more than 1 parameters are expected.`
}

console.log(spreadOperator());
console.log(restOperator());
